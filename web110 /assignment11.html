    <p>Semantic HTML Elements:
        In the first activity, I focused on using semantic HTML elements to enhance accessibility and structure in web pages.
        Semantic elements, such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, and <article>, provide meaningful context to content.
        By using these elements, I learned that:
        Accessibility improves: Screen readers and assistive technologies can better interpret the content.
        SEO benefits: Search engines understand the page structure, leading to better rankings.
        Personally, I find semantic elements essential for creating well-organized and user-friendly websites.
        In my future projects, Iâ€™ll consistently apply semantic elements to ensure accessibility and maintainable code.
        W3C Markup Validation:
        For the second activity, I used the W3C Markup Validation Service to validate my HTML code.
        Validation helps identify syntax errors, non-standard practices, and potential issues.
        What I learned:
        Error detection: The tool flagged any issues, such as unclosed tags or invalid attributes.
        Cross-browser compatibility: Valid markup ensures consistent rendering across browsers.
        I envision applying this concept by:
        Regularly validating my code during development.
        Ensuring my websites adhere to web standards for better user experiences.</p>
