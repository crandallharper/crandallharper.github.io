    <p>Based on my research, I learned that Brave, Chrome, and Edge are all popular web browsers with their own strengths and weaknesses. Brave is known for its privacy and security-focused features, while Edge provides a more functional and unique user experience. Chrome is also a very popular choice, but it was not included in this comparison.

        In terms of security features, Brave provides solid features to block trackers and enhance your online privacy. Braveâ€™s anti-tracking feature is more aggressive than Microsoft Edge. On the other hand, Microsoft Edge has been adding many improvements to enhance both privacy and security aspects. Microsoft Edge lets you block trackers and enable special browsing protection to check for untrusted and malicious websites. While the anti-tracking feature may not be as good as Brave, you get a few more features in Microsoft Edge.
        
        When it comes to performance, Brave is the winner in my opinion. Brave blocks trackers and ads automatically, thus saving time and downloading less. This feature makes it faster than Edge.
        
        Overall, each browser has its own strengths and weaknesses. If you are looking for a browser that is fast and secure, Brave is the way to go. If you want a browser that is more functional and has a unique user experience, Microsoft Edge is a good pick.
    How I envision being able to apply the concept to my own future would be I know know the differences between the different browsers because of the stuff I learned in the activities that I did.</p>
