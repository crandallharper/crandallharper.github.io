    <p>Based on my research, I learned that Brave, Chrome, and Edge are all popular web browsers with their own strengths and weaknesses. Brave is known for its privacy and security-focused features, while Edge provides a more functional and unique user experience. Chrome is also a very popular choice, but it was not included in this comparison.

        In terms of security features, Brave provides solid features to block trackers and enhance your online privacy. Braveâ€™s anti-tracking feature is more aggressive than Microsoft Edge. On the other hand, Microsoft Edge has been adding many improvements to enhance both privacy and security aspects. Microsoft Edge lets you block trackers and enable special browsing protection to check for untrusted and malicious websites. While the anti-tracking feature may not be as good as Brave, you get a few more features in Microsoft Edge.
        
        When it comes to performance, Brave is the winner in my opinion. Brave blocks trackers and ads automatically, thus saving time and downloading less. This feature makes it faster than Edge.
        Overall, each browser has its own strengths and weaknesses. If you are looking for a browser that is fast and secure, Brave is the way to go. If you want a browser that is more functional and has a unique user experience, Microsoft Edge is a good pick.

        activity #2 configure the braves browser settings and advanced settings and modify any settings that would improve your Internet experience. 
        So Brave is a web browser that focuses on privacy, security and performance. It has many settings and advanced features that allow users to customize their browsing experience. Here is a summary of some of the main settings and how to modify them.
        Shields: This is where you can adjust the level of protection against trackers, ads, fingerprinting, cookies and scripts. You can also view the statistics of how many items Brave has blocked. To improve your privacy and security, you can enable the highest level of blocking for each option.
        Privacy and security: This is where you can manage your browsing data, passwords, autofill, extensions, Tor, IPFS and more.
        Search engine: This is where you can choose your default search engine and manage other search engines. You can also enable or disable autocomplete searches and URLs. To improve your privacy and security, you can choose a privacy-respecting search engine such as DuckDuckGo. Thats what I use. 
        Appearance: This is where you can customize the look and feel of Brave, such as the theme, font size, zoom, toolbar, homepage and bookmarks.
        
        How I envision being able to apply the concept to my own future would be I know know the differences between the different browsers because of the stuff I learned in the activities that I did.</p>
