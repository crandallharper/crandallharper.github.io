    <p>Activity: Review GCFLearnFree: Blog Basics Topic: I learned the basics of blogging, such as what a blog is, who blogs, why people blog, and how to create a blog. Learning: I learned that a blog is a website with regular updates, that there are different types of blogs for different purposes and audiences, and that people blog for various reasons, such as to share, to connect, to write, or to promote. Application: I think blogging could be a great way to express myself, to share my opinions and interests, to connect with like-minded people, and to improve my writing skills.
    Activity: Review GCFLearnFree: Facebook Topic: I learned how to create, use, and maintain a Facebook page, and how to understand Facebook privacy policies and settings. Learning: I learned that Facebook is the world’s largest social network, where I can connect with friends, family, and people who share my interests. I learned how to sign up for Facebook, how to create a profile, how to post updates, how to chat and message, and how to adjust my account and privacy settings. I also learned about Facebook’s features, such as groups, pages, texts, and news. Application: I think Facebook could be a useful tool for me to stay in touch with my loved ones, to meet new people, to discover new things, and to express myself.
