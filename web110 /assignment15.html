            <h2>Final Project Topic: Comparative Analysis of Web Browsers</h2>
            <p> My final project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of popular web browsers, including Brave, Chrome, and Edge, focusing on their strengths and weaknesses in terms of privacy, security, performance, and user experience. The scope of the project includes evaluating each browser's security features, performance metrics, customization options, and unique functionalities. By comparing these browsers, we aim to provide insights into their suitability for different user preferences and needs. In addition to the comparative analysis of web browsers, the presentation will cover other course topics such as web browser safety, search engine optimization (SEO). These topics will be discussed to demonstrate mastery of course concepts and their real-world applications. Also, some of the earlier assignments I will be doing. </p>
