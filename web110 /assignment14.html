    <p> I recently completed two activities to learn about HTML and building a simple web page. First, I went through tutorials from W3Schools, TutorialsPoint, Mozilla, and SoloLearn to grasp the basics of HTML. Then, I followed a guide by ShayHowe to build my first web page, incorporating elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, and links. Afterwards, I used an HTML online editor to create a web page dedicated to my favorite hobby. I included an <img> tag to add a free image from Wikimedia Commons, enhancing the visual appeal of my page. Through these activities, I learned how to structure a web page using HTML, incorporate images, and create links to other pages or resources. It was a hands-on experience that gave me a solid understanding of the fundamentals of web development. </p>
