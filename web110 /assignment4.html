    <p>Activity 1: Email Basics and E-mail Overview

      Activity 1: Email Basics and E-mail Overview
For this activity, I delved into the fundamental aspects of email communication. I learned about its purpose, functionality, and essential terminology.

        In this activity, I learned the basics of email, such as what it is, how it works, and why it is useful. I also learned the common terms and features of email, such as inbox, spam, attachments, and signatures. I learned how to compose, send, and receive email messages using an email client or a web-based service. I also learned how to organize, delete, and archive my email messages.
        
        I can apply this learning to my own current or future environment by using email as a primary mode of communication for personal or professional purposes. Email can help me stay in touch with my friends, family, colleagues, or customers. It can also help me share information, documents, or files with others. Email can also help me manage my tasks, appointments, or projects. I envision being able to use email effectively and efficiently in any situation that requires online communication.
        


        Activity 2: Send, receive, and respond to email

        Activity 2: Send, Receive, and Respond to Email
        For this activity, I focused on practical skills related to using Gmail, a widely used web-based email service.
        
        In this activity, I learned how to use Gmail, one of the most popular web-based email services, to send, receive, and respond to email messages. I learned how to create a Gmail account, sign in, and access my inbox. I learned how to compose a new email message, add recipients, subject, and body. I learned how to attach files, insert images, or add links to my email message. I learned how to send my email message and check if it was delivered. I also learned how to open, read, and reply to an email message I received from someone else. I learned how to use the reply, reply all, and forward options to continue or share the conversation.
        
        I can apply this learning to my own current or future environment by using Gmail as my preferred email service for personal or professional communication. Gmail can offer me many benefits, such as a large storage space, a user-friendly interface, a powerful search function, and a spam filter. Gmail can also integrate with other Google products, such as Google Drive, Google Calendar, or Google Meet. I envision being able to use Gmail to communicate with anyone who has an email address, and to access my email from any device that has an internet connection.</p>
