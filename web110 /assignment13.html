        LESSON SUMMARY: Through completing these activities with the Northwind database, I gained practical experience in querying a database without using a dedicated application. I learned to identify table structures, primary keys, and relationships between tables. Additionally, I practiced using SQL commands to filter and extract specific information from the database, such as customer names, product details, and order information. This experience is directly applicable to real-world scenarios where I may need to interact with databases for data analysis, reporting, or application development. Understanding how to formulate SQL queries enables me to retrieve relevant data efficiently, make informed decisions, and derive valuable insights from large datasets in various professional settings.
