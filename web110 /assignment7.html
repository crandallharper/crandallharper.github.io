    <p>Activity 1: Practice web browser safety.

        In this activity, I reviewed the privacy and security settings of different web browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, and Safari. I learned how to adjust the settings to control what information is shared with websites, how to block or allow cookies and pop-ups, how to manage passwords and autofill data, and how to clear browsing history and cache. I also learned about the features and benefits of each browser, such as incognito mode, tracking protection, and VPN integration. I realized that web browser safety is essential for preventing identity theft, phishing, malware, and other online threats.
        
        I can apply the concept of web browser safety to my own current or future environment by choosing the browser that best suits my needs and preferences, and by regularly updating and reviewing the settings to ensure optimal security. I can also educate others about the importance of web browser safety and how to practice it effectively.
        
        Activity 2: Use anti-malware software to scan your system and test malware detection.

        In this activity, I used a free, well-known anti-malware application to scan my system and test its malware detection capabilities. I reviewed the Wikipedia article on the comparison of antivirus software and selected one that had good ratings and reviews. I downloaded and installed the application and ran a full scan of my system. I learned how to interpret the scan results and how to quarantine or delete any detected threats. I also learned how to update the application and schedule regular scans to keep my system protected.

I also tested the malware detection of the application by using the EICAR test file, which is a harmless file that simulates a virus. I downloaded and saved the file to my system and observed how the application reacted. I learned how to follow the process for removing malware, such as disabling the internet connection, ending the suspicious processes, deleting the malicious files, and restoring the system settings. I understood how the EICAR test file can help me evaluate the effectiveness of my anti-malware application and how to use it safely.

I can apply the concept of using anti-malware software to scan my system and test malware detection to my own current or future environment by keeping my anti-malware application updated and active, and by performing regular scans of my system. I can also use the EICAR test file to check the performance of my application and to troubleshoot any issues. I can also share my knowledge and experience with others who may need help with using anti-malware software.</p>
