    <p>Activity: Compare search engines.

        In this activity, I searched for web search engine using four different search engines: Google, Bing, Yahoo, and Ask. I compared the results from each search engine in terms of user interface, relevance, and features.
        
        I learned that web search engines are software systems that find web pages that match a web search query. I also learned that there are many types of web search engines, such as general, specialized, meta, and deep web search engines. Each search engine has its own strengths and weaknesses, and may cater to different user needs and preferences.
        
        I found that Google had the best user interface among the four search engines. It was simple, fast, and easy to use. It also had many options and tools to refine and customize the search, such as filters, advanced search, and Google Lens. Google also provided the most useful results for my query, as it showed me relevant and authoritative sources, such as Wikipedia, Lifewire, and Statista. Google also had some unique features, such as zero-click information, knowledge graph, and featured snippets, that gave me quick answers and insights.
        Activity: Learn about Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

        In this activity, I learned about Search Engine Optimization (SEO), which is the process of affecting the visibility of a website or a web page in a web search engines unpaid results, often referred to as “natural”, “organic”, or “earned” results. I also practiced by adding this Wikiversity page URL to Google Search, following the steps and guidelines from Google: Get your content on Google.

        I learned that SEO involves various techniques and strategies to improve the ranking and relevance of a website or a web page for certain keywords or topics that users search for. I also learned that SEO can help increase the traffic, quality, and credibility of a website or a web page. Some of the factors that affect SEO are the content, the structure, the performance, the security, and the user experience of the website or the web page.

        I envision being able to apply the concept of SEO to my own current or future environment in various ways. For example, I can use it to:

        Create and maintain a website or a web page that is user-friendly, informative, and engaging, and that meets the needs and expectations of my target audience.
        Optimize my website or my web page for search engines, and make sure that it follows the best practices and standards of SEO, such as using relevant keywords, titles, headings, meta tags, links, images, and sitemaps.</p>
