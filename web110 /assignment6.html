    <p>The first activity was Review IP address settings for your local network. In this activity, I learned how to check and change the TCP/IP settings of my network adapter using the Windows Control Panel and the command prompt. I also learned how to use the ipconfig command to display the IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server of my system. I practiced how to release and renew a dynamic IP address using the ipconfig /release and ipconfig /renew commands. This activity helped me understand how IP addresses are assigned and configured on a local network, and how to troubleshoot network adapter problems.
      The second activity was Review Ping/Host. In this activity, I learned how to use the ping command to test the connectivity between my system and other hosts on the network or the Internet. I pinged my local IP address, my default gateway address, and an Internet host (8.8.8.8) and observed the results. I learned how to interpret the output of the ping command, such as the round-trip time, the packet loss, and the error messages. This activity helped me diagnose network problems and verify the reachability of different hosts, and how to use the host command to get the domain name of an IP address.
